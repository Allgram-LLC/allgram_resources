“As we’ve come to realize, the idea that security starts and ends with the purchase of a prepackaged firewall is simply misguided.” – [Art Wittmann](https://www.blue-pencil.ca/8-tweetable-cybersecurity-quotes-to-help-you-and-your-business-stay-safer/)

As the Internet has become a necessity rather than a luxury in recent years, users may assume that security and privacy are at the forefront of their experiences. After all, why would the big tech giants and social media platforms risk compromising our data and information for all the world to see or discover with creative ingenious?

Lo and behold, such thoughts are unsurprisingly naïve. On Tuesday, Ken Macon of [Reclaim the Net considered](https://reclaimthenet.org/leaked-document-shows-the-eu-countries-that-want-to-ban-private-messaging) a leaked European Council survey about the perspectives of encryption for member countries. Namely, Spain supports banning end-to-end encryption.

Although this measure is in the name of combating the disbursement of child sexual abuse material (CSAM), this potentially risks the elimination of privacy for all citizens. Despite these good intentions, nations like Italy, Germany, Finland and Estonia do not support end-to-end encryption.

Along with the right to privacy being at risk for those in the European Union, cybersecurity faces as much external threats as it does internally for users. Much like Charlie Osborne wrote in an [article](https://www.zdnet.com/article/online-security-101-how-to-protect-your-privacy-from-hackers-spies-and-the-government/) on Jan. 21, 2022, for ZDNet, while there have been some changes to rules and regulations presented in the guise of being just and good for the users, there is evidence to the contrary.

Simply put, projecting the antithesis to genuine, factual implementation of protecting users from threats on the Internet are indelible as ensuring sensitive, Personally Identifiable Information (PII) stays with the individuals, not corporate giants or a governing body.

All told, users are realizing how tech and government do not always hold their best interests with privacy and cybersecurity measures. In a Nov. 19, 2019, [article](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/) for the Pew Research Center, written by Brooke Auxier and her colleagues, 81% of Americans feel they lack control over data collected by companies while 84% express similar concerns with the government.

Privacy and cybersecurity are frequently encountered on a daily basis. Consider the most recent instance in which a website asks a user to agree to a privacy on a monthly basis. According to the same research by the Pew Research Center, 32% of users responded that such a privacy policy agreement occurs once a week.
