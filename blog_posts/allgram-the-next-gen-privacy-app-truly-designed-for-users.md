“Data protection is about making sure the data is kept safe from theft and misuse by those who should not have access to it.” – [Laureen Knudsen, Broadcom](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/02/27/13-tech-experts-explain-essential-facts-about-data-privacy-and-data-protection/?sh=284911a61d99)

In today’s technologically driven world, privacy and security are indelible intangibles for the truly authentic, meaningful user experience on social media applications (apps). Whether social media apps are used to interact with family and friends or run a business to engage with customers around the world, privacy and security are at the forefront of social media users for peace of mind and trust with their online experiences.

As Dale Renner of Redpoint Global Inc., said, “While data privacy relates to how brands collect and use consumer data, data protection from security threats is a separate concern. While the two are distinct in terms of how they are approached by brands, protecting both elements are key to building and maintaining trust with consumers, which will result in a strong and secure brand reputation.”
